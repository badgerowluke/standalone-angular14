# Standalone Component Example

The intent of this repository is to provide a demonstration of a number of practices within front-end development, specifically with Angular.  The first is the inclusion of stand-alone components, and the concept of a stand-alone application; removing the reliance on the `NgModules` concept.

The second is utilizing library projects and component driven development with Storybook to speed up development time and improve code reuse.
